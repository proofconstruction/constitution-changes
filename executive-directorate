# Constitution

This document describes the highest level of governance structures for projects under the NixOS Foundation.

The following sections define the separation of powers between the different bodies.

## Executive Directorate
The Executive Directorate is an elected primary executive body for the official NixOS organization. Its purpose is to centralize the operations of the org, according to regulations determined by the Steering Committee. Certain responsibilities may be delegated as necessary.

### Structure

#### Executive Director
The Executive Directorate is headed by the Executive Director, whose responsibilities include the following:
- to be the central point of contact for the official teams to communicate with the Standing Committee and the Foundation Board,
- to be the highest point of escalation for the Moderation Team,
- to be the concentration point for the leadership of the [official teams](https://nixos.org/community/#Teams) (this link doesn't actually bring you to the Teams section on the Community page, but it should... and this is an example of why we need better accountability from the Marketing Team!)
- to be the final arbiter of disputes which affect the organization
- to be the face of organization-wide decisions, including but not limited to the forging of alliances with other organizations (e.g. the Haskell Foundation)
- to own the internal and external communication of the organization's goals and activities.
- to centralize reporting and accountability for the NixOS organization: the activities conducted by the official teams should be visible for several reasons, and this visibility should be established and ensured by the Executive Director; all teams are accountable to their team leads, and all team leads will report to the Executive Director.

#### Moderation Team
The Moderation Team is tasked with maintaining healthy and productive dialogue in the community, when necessary enforcing points from the Nix Community Code of Conduct.

In the past few years, this team has made several moderation actions which have been contentious, and negative opinion has grown within a sizable subset of the community. Following this, the moderation team has been subject to rhetorical attacks - and spam - by bad-faith actors.

Under this proposal, the moderation team would report to the Executive Director, whose corresponding responsibilities will include decisively guiding the public narrative around events like this, coordinating and establishing a messaging baseline for the Foundation as a whole.

#### Marketing and Documentation Teams
Similar to the case with the Moderation Team, the Marketing Team would report to and be accountable to the Executive Director, who would ensure the coordination of public messaging efforts across all teams.

The reports delivered to the Executive Director by the individual teams will be periodically aggregated and a single Teams Report delivered to the Marketing Team for widespread release.

The Documentation Team has the responsibility to produce high-quality learning and reference materials for the community. As we've found in the past few years, the documentation effort is an inherently political one. The choice of what to document and how is one which requires buy-in from the broader community, to determine topics whose coverage is most desired, and to establish a consistent narrative voice and direction. By serving as the nexus for all teams and for the community as a whole, the Executive Director can do exactly this.

#### Official Teams
While it is the responsibility of the Standing Committee to determine and formalize which teams are "official", the actual day-to-day operations of those teams are under the purview of the Executive Directorate.

Today, the official teams are staffed by volunteers and people supported by various payers to develop the Nix ecosystem. Each team has a team lead, responsible for organizing that team's labor effort and outputs.

There is currently no formal mechanism for teams to coordinate at any higher level than ad-hoc messaging, which frequently results in duplication of efforts, lack of transparency around decisionmaking, and unclear paths to new contributions.

Under this proposed constitution, the team leads would report to the Executive Director, who would in turn be responsible for coordinating their efforts according to a shared vision of the project's future.

### Responsibilities and Authority
In order to guide the projects in accordance with Nix Community Values, the Executive Directorate shall have the following responsibilities.

- Ensure the execution of processes for granting access to projects and resources
- Build and maintain beneficial and collaborative relationships
- Own public communication resources and activity
- Manage the direction of the Foundation's official projects when necessary
  - Ensure that project direction decisions and where the decisions came from are made explicit
    - Ensure timeliness of decisions as far as possible
    - Ensure that stalling on decisions is made explicit when unavoidable
      - When possible, recommend time or condition for followup
- Delegate authority to long-term teams.

## Steering Committee (SC)

The SC is an elected primary governing body for official Nix projects. Its relationship with the Foundation is that of a peer organization with a different focus.

### Responsibilities and Authority

In order to guide the projects in accordance with Nix Community Values the Steering Committee shall have the following responsibilities, which it should delegate when appropriate.

- Manage which resources are considered official and manage the official resources
  - As of the time of establishment of SC, the [official resources](https://github.com/NixOS/org/blob/main/doc/resources.md) and access to them are listed in the repository
  - In particular, ensure existence of processes for granting access to the projects and to the resources
  - Ensure that the processes for making regular decisions exist and function
  - Ensure that escalation points exist and work
    - Final (until significant changes in the circumstances or available data and arguments) decision authority may be delegated, when significant analysis of the issue and the arguments is needed to build the competence to make a good decision. However, if the team receiving the authority does not reach internal consensus, the SC still has the responsibility for handling the delegation failure.
  - Evolve the constitution, including governance structure and governance processes, when appropriate, under supermajority requirements
- Formalizing existing teams and creating future ones to serve particular needs as articulated by the Executive Directorate.
  - In communication with the Executive Directorate, evolve policy of long-term teams and committees.
  - Delegate analysis of arguments from all sides and the making of a consensus (inside the team) decision on specific contentious issues to short-lived teams or committees.
- In communication with the NixOS Foundation Board and the Executive Directorate, set the policies and priorities for highly visible actions and events, and the resources under the care of the Foundation
  - Any delegation of this responsibility also delegates the communication with the Board and Directorate on the delegated topics.

### Decision process

#### Extraordinary Decisions

The following decisions require at least a 2/3 supermajority agreement of the full SC size (vacant seats count as abstaining).

* Changing the constitution
* Forced removal of SC members
* Disqualifications of candidates in an election (supermajority among the currently serving non-running members)
* Replacement of Executive Director

Furthermore, the SC decides on the EC (fixme: definition of "electoral committee" should occur before any uses of "EC") with a 2/3 supermajority. If the SC cannot come to supermajority agreement on the list of EC members, they will conduct an election using the same tallying system as the previous SC election, where only SC members can vote.

Substantial amendments to the Nix Community Values require 90% (fixme: why not >50% simple majority or 2/3 supermajority?) agreement in a poll among eligible voters. Deciding that an amendment is not substantial can be done by unanimity among a full SC. (fixme: Why unanimity?)

#### Ordinary decisions

Everything within the authority of SC that doesn't require an extraordinary decision can be decided with a simple majority (at least 50%) of a full SC (vacant seats count as abstaining).

An exception to that is when there is when the [conflict of interest balance](#conflict-of-interest-balance) condition is suspected to be violated, in which case all non-involved currently-serving SC members will have a simple majority decision over whether there is a violation.

### Composition and Appointment

The SC consists of 7 elected members.
Regular elections are once a year, with half (alternating rounding every year) of the seats up for election,
such that each member holds a seat for one term of at most 2 years before it is up for election again.
Members can at most serve two consecutive terms. (fixme: Is there a global term limit? Is 2 terms on, 1 off, 2 on again permissible?)

The previous SC appoints an Election Committee (EC) of at least 3 people to administer the election. If the SC cannot come to supermajority agreement on the list of EC members, they will conduct an election using the same tallying system as the previous SC election, where only SC members can vote.
SC members can be EC members only if they're leaving after the election.

#### Vote eligibility

Before the election process is initiated, the EC selects a cutoff date.
Only contributions to official projects in the four years preceding the cutoff date are considered.

There are two automatic ways to become eligible for voting, either:
- Have authored enough merged PRs to the [NixOS GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nixos) to total at least 25 commits.
- Have merged any PR to the NixOS GitHub organisation.

(fixme: this should be reworded; does this mean that non-committing maintainers who click the merge button on PRs are eligible, or something else?)

The list of automatically eligible voters is made public.

People not automatically eligible then have some time to send a request to the EC, which can then make an exception and approve them as voters. This is for people whose official contributions are not visible in the NixOS GitHub organisation, such as:
- Official event organisers and speakers
- Maintainers of official third-party accounts (e.g. social media)
- etc.

After the decisions on exception requests are made, the list of approved requests is also made public.

Not eligible in any case are bot accounts and people that are banned at the time when the list of automatically eligible voters is published.

#### Candidates

The requirements to become a candidate for the SC elections are:
- To be eligible for voting
- Agree to be a candidate
- Provide a public position statement, why the candidate should be elected and what are the positions on the current issues.
- To be endorsed by at least 3 other people eligible to vote
  - Among the candidate and their endorsers, there must be at least 4 individuals where no two have the same conflict of interest (e.g. employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work), as decided by the EC.
  - One can endorse a person who has not yet agreed to be a candidate, which also serves as nominating them (subject to acceptance of nomination)
  - Members of electorate may endorse multiple nominees, but we expect endorsements to be be in good faith
- To have been not a member of the SC for at least two complete years of the two immediately preceding terms
- To not be a member of the EC
- To not have any conflicts of interest that would [prevent one from being appointed](#conflict-of-interest-balance) to the SC, and publicly disclose all potential conflicts of interest
  - This includes conflicts of interest to arise during the term based on already finalised agreements

After the nomination deadline, the SC can prevent a nominee from becoming a candidate by supermajority (2/3 agreement among the currently serving non-running members of the SC) in case their public image or conduct would not be compatible with the position in the SC.

#### Procedure

The currently selected procedure uses [Condorcet Internet Voting Service](https://civs1.civs.us/) in a proportional representation mode. The voters will receive their unique URLs for accessing the vote.

In any election where seats with different end-of-term dates are available, winning candidates with higher final election rankings are appointed to the longer terms.

#### Special considerations for the first SC election

- To stagger the terms, the first election will appoint half the members rounded up with 2-year terms and the remaining members with 1-year terms.
- The EC for the first election will be the members of the [Nix Constitutional Assembly (NCA)](https://github.com/nixos/nix-constitutional-assembly?tab=readme-ov-file#members).
- And to help the first elected SC establish itself, members of the NCA are integrated into the SC as non-voting members for 6 months after the appointment.

#### Conflict of Interest (CoI) Balance

To encourage diversity there is a soft limit of one individuals with the same CoI (e.g. employees of the same company or otherwise the same payer for Nix work) immediately after election results coming into force. If the results of an election would result in multiple individuals with the same CoI being elected, the lowest vote getters with any particular CoI will be removed until the condition is satisfied. In case of doubts (subsidiaries etc.) the election committee makes a decision. The candidates must disclose already-agreed-upon changes of affilation that are to happen during the term, and at the time of election these are taken into consideration as same-employer collisions.

Furthermore, there is a hard maximum of two employees with the same CoI at any time. If this condition is suspected to be violated because of job changes, acquisitions, or other events, all non-involved currently-serving SC members will have a simple majority decision over whether there is a violation. In case it is deemed a violation, sufficient members of the committee must resign until the max representation limit is achieved. If it is impossible to find sufficient members to resign, the entire company’s representation will be removed and a new special election is held.

#### Special Elections

In the event of a resignation or other loss of a steering committee member (including a [removal for conduct](#removal-for-conduct)), a special election for that position may be held if the SC deems it necessary, or SC does not have half of normal size. Otherwise the missing positions are assumed to be abstaining from all the SC votes. A committee member elected in a special election will serve out the remainder of the term for the person they are replacing, regardless of the length of that remainder.

#### Full Reelections

A majority (fixme: simple majority or super majority?) within the SC may call a reelection of the entire SC based on perceived loss of confidence. In this case it also has to be decided whether this election is considered a special election for the remainders of all the corresponding terms, or an initial election for full 2-year terms for half of the seats rounded up, and 1-year half-terms for the remaining seats. (fixme: How is this decided?)

(fixme: If only the SC can call its own reelection, there could be situations where the community has lost confidence in the SC and where the SC chooses not to call for its reelection; this could escalate into a serious crisis. What about adding a provision for the eligible voters to hold a referendum and call a reelection by simple majority?)

### Removal for conduct

A supermajority within the SC may remove SC members for violating the community expectations for members in positions of high authority. The reasons include but are not limited to unfitting conduct and unavailability, and a summary of the reason should be respectfully described. The SC is explicitly expected to be held to higher standards than applied to project communication in general.

The removal can be justification for a special election where the removed person is not eligible to be a candidate.

## NixOS Foundation Board

[Foundation board | Nix & NixOS](https://nixos.org/community/teams/foundation-board/)

#### Responsibilities

The board is a partner with the SC in leadership and is primarily focused on the corporate and general external relationships, fiscal/financial, legal, partnership etc.

In particular, its responsibilities are to:
* Own and handle the administrative and legal
    * Serve as an interface between the community and the corporate/governmental/financial world:
    * Trademark
* Handle external relationships, partnerships and donations
    * Work with the SC to establish foundation policies that balance the interests of volunteers, commercial actors, and public institutions, while staying within legal and administrative feasibility constraints. This includes sponsorship, trademark policies, etc.
    * Maintain and support grants/grant providers
* Provide a framework for the community to self-organise:
    * Handle payments for tooling, meetups, infra, etc.
    * Manage credentials and permissions
* Owns and is responsible for financials
    * Provide fiscal planning and funding for community events and efforts
    * The Foundation board decides how much funding is available for each broadly scoped type of events and efforts, while the SC decides the priorities within these scopes and limits of the allocated funds.

### Board Composition Changes

Board changes are decided by a selection committee composed of some delegates from the current board and some delegates from the SC. To block any specific new or continuing appointment of a person, objections from a number of delegates equal to the size of the smaller delegation of the two (board or SC) suffice. For example, with 1 delegate from the board, and 3 delegates from the SC, one delegate from either can block an appointment.

This procedure can be invoked by the SC or the board at any point in time.
